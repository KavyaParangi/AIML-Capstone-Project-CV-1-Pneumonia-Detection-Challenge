## Project Description

**Project Description**
  - In this capstone project, the goal is to build a pneumonia detec)on system, to locate the posi)on of inflamma)on in an image.Tissues with sparse material, such as
    lungs which are full of air, do not absorb the X-rays and appear black in the image. Dense )ssues such as bones absorb X-rays and appear white in the image.While       we are theore)cally detec)ng “lung opaci)es”, there are lung opaci)es that are not pneumonia related.In the data, some of these are labeled “Not Normal No Lung         Opacity”. This extra third class indicates that while pneumonia was determined not to be present, there was nonetheless some type of abnormality on the image and       oUen)mes this finding may mimic the appearance of true pneumonia.Dicom original images: - Medical images are stored in a special format called DICOM files (*.dcm).     They contain a combina)on of header metadata as well as underlying raw image arrays for pixel data.

<Resize the training images to a standard size like 224x224>
<create same number of masks as number of images, size 28x28> 

Previous_patient_ID = Blanks
Start loop
   mask[i] = np.zeros(image_size) # to create a blank mask
   Read train_labels next row 	
   if (Previous_patient_ID == current_Patient_ID)  # means another patch in the same xray
      get dimensions of the bounding box from train_labels row
      resize the bounding box as per the mask size (refer the computer vision notebook)
      move the bounding box pixels from the main image to the mask (refer the computer vision notebook)

   else    # new patient row, this could or coudnt have pneumonia	 
      if target == 1 # pneumonia detected
         get dimensions of the bounding box from train_labels row
         resize the bounding box as per the mask size 
         move the bounding box pixels from the main image to the mask
         Previous_patient_ID = current_Patient_ID
      <end of if statement>
   <end of if-else>
<end of loop>

When target = 0, we can keep a blank mask as the output.
